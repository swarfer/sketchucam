   <TD>USER REQUEST</td>
<td>
   I was using the centerline tool and the perimeter cut tool on 1/4in acrylic sheet today. 
   I use the centerline tool at variable depths such as 50% usually. With a 1/8in diameter 
   bit I am always nervous about breaking it ($35 a piece!) so I tend to slow the travel 
   speed down to about 20in/m  universally so when I do the full cut through the 1/4 I don't 
   risk breaking the bit. But on the 50% cuts I could be running 50in plus. Right now the 
   only way is to go into the gcode and try to find it and make manual changes.
<p>I can't control spindle speed on my router, but I was wondering if it would be a big additional 
   change to have two variables when you select any tool that can have a % depth to also have an 
   entry for travel speed. </p>
   <p>
   Thoughts: could provide for feed speed scaling between a 'speed at 100% depth' to 'speed at <100% depth' where
      speed at 100% will be less than speed at some <100% depth.

         NAME is the name of the profile.
      Profile names must not have spaces or punctuation in them, but can be as long as 250 characters.
   </pre>
   <li>CW/CWW choices for plunge holes and pockets
   <pre>
      Set one or more of
         Use_pocket_CW = false
         Use_plunge_CW = false
      to true to get CW cuts on pockets and plunge holes respectively.  
      Normally these will cut CCW to use climb-milling but if the machine 
      is not stiff enough CW will give a better finish.  The overhead gantry setting 
      will not affect this.
   </pre>
   <li>Phlatprinter outfeed option
   <pre>
      Set
         Use_outfeed = false
      to true to use the outfeed feature.   This is ONLY for Phlatprinters.
      Normally a Phlatprinter will go to 'home' at the end of a job, which means that
      the material is sticking out the back of the machine.
      Setting this option to true causes the material to be fed forward out of the machine
      to 75% of the material 'safe length'.  This should make it easier to remove at the end
      of a job.

1.1d  7 Mar 2014
<dl>
<dt>Group summary
   <dd>Tools|Phlatboyz|Groups Summary
   <dd>Gives a listing of groups in the order they will be cut

<dt>Sketchup Make 2014
   <dd>This uses Ruby 2 which has some API changes. 
   <dd>Parameterstool.rb fixed to use .each_line instead of .each for strings.
   <dd>attributes.rb: changed $f to f to prevent Make2014 moaning. 
   
<dt>Parameters dialog for Mac
   <dd>Fixes to the html to make it work on Mac, so 
      'Use_compatible_dialogs = false' should now work on Mac
      (thanks to Krzysztof)
<dt>Phlatboyz.strings language handler
   <dd>Changes to the language handler so it works across all versions of Sketchup.
   Note that any translations you find on the web are probably out of date by now.  
   Feel free to update the translations and forward them to the dev team.

<h2>1.1e May 2014</h2>
<dl>
<dd>profile file format was changed to ini format, extension .pri, as a way to test the iniparser library
<dt>fix for parameters tool on mac
<dt>phlatBones preferences file moved to profiles folder, solves write permissions issue on Win7/8
<dt>Pocketcut: improved undo so entire pocket cut will undo in one operation
<dt>arcs, tried optimizing to IJ format but some offset arcs are unfixable, reverted to R format with extra digit of precision
<dt>3D - removed full depth plunge at start of last multipass pass that may remove extra material.
<dt>beta5 - added Z-Zero option to parameters dialog
</dl>
