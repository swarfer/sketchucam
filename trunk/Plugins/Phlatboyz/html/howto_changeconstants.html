<h2>HOWTO change the default settings in Constants.rb</h2>

<div  style="background-color: cyan;">
<p>
Please note that this mechanism has been superceded by the Tools|Phlatboyz|Options menu system.<br>
Current settings in Constants.rb and MyConstants.rb will be honored but overridden by the new settings mechanism, so it is best if you use that.
</p>
<p><a href="howto_options.html">READ ABOUT THE NEW OPTIONS MENUS HERE</a></p>
</div>

<p>
The Phlatscript system has long had a file called Constants.rb which contains
a long list of contant values.  Some of them are used only by the system and are not user settable 
while others are designed to be user settings that you set once and forget.
</p>
<p>Current development of the system revealed that Constants.rb will be changing often as new features 
are added, thus presenting the problem of 'merging' the new file with your existing options such as default 
safe cut area and so on.
</p>
<p>
A new system had to be designed and the simplest is to have a secondary constants file in which you set your options.
This file will never be updated by a SketchUcam system upgrade, and so the developers can happily add features
without it impacting the upgrade process.
</p>
<h3>MyConstants.rb</h3>
<p>

<table border=1 align=right width="20%" cellspacing=0>
<tr>
<td>
<a id="mac" ><b>Windows/Mac/Linux users : finding the Plugins/Phlatboyz folder</b></a>
<ol>
<li>Open Sketchup
<li>Open the Ruby console, <i>Window|Ruby Console</i>
<li>Paste this string into the Ruby command line   
   <code>Sketchup.find_support_file('Plugins')</code>
   and press enter
<li>The path to your Plugins folder will be displayed, Phlatboyz is a subfolder, and the MyConstants-example.rb file is in there.   
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

This new file is named MyConstants.rb and the distribution .RBZ file <b>does not contain one</b><br>
WHAT!?<br>
Well, if the distribution contained one it would get overwritten by an upgrade.
Instead, there is a file<br> 
<code>C:\Program Files\Google\Google SketchUp 8\Plugins\Phlatboyz\MyConstants-example.rb</code> 
<a href="#path">(see path note for Sketchup Make)</a>
which contains mostly the same defaults as Constants.rb except that some are metric and all the system specific
stuff that you don't need to mess with (and shouldn't mess with) has been left out.
</p>

<h3>How to use this file?</h3>
<p>
The distributed files assume you have a Phlatprinter that is not a Phlatprinter 3, and thus the
option for using an overhead gantry is false.   Now, you can try to remember to always set that 'true' in the
parameters dialog, or you can set the default, BUT HOW?
</p>

<h4>Follow these steps:</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Close Sketchup
	<li>Navigate to <code>C:\Program Files\Google\Google SketchUp 8\Plugins\Phlatboyz </code>
	<li>RIGHT-click Drag & drop 'MyConstants-example.rb' in that same folder and select 'Copy' from the
		menu that pops up.  It will be named something like <b>'MyConstants-example - Copy.rb'</b>
	<li>Select the file
	<li>Press 'F2' to enter rename mode
	<li>rename it to <b>MyConstants.rb</b>
	</ol>
	Yay, you have a file you can personalize, lets do that....
	<ol>
	<li>Click Start|All Programs|Accessories|Notepad
	<li>now drag and drop MyConstants.rb onto Notepad
	<li>Find <code>Default_overhead_gantry </code> and change 'false' to 'true'. (The example 
		file will sometimes have this set true, and sometimes not).<br>
		So now it looks like<br>
			<code>Default_overhead_gantry = true</code>
	<li>Note that because you are editing a computer language file the format has to be followed EXACTLY 
		since the computer is dumb and cannot 'interpret' language it was not designed for.  So, take 
		special care to keep spaces and symbols etc in keeping with what is already there.  <br>
		<b>Sketchup will fail to load the SketchUcam toolbar if you get anything wrong in this file.</b>
	</ol>
<h3>Now let us test Sketchup	</h3>
<ol>	
	<li>Open Sketchup
	<li>Click the icon for the Parameters Dialog <img src="../images/parameterstool_large.png"> in the SketchUcam toolbar.
	<li>You should see that the checkbox for 'Overhead Gantry' is ticked.  Success!
	<li>If it is not checked, or the toolbar does not load, you need to check the syntax of 
	whatever you changed in MyConstants.rb and fix it.<br>  
	If all your efforts fail, just rename the file to anything but the current name and it will be ignored.
	Now make a new copy of the example file and try again.
</ol>	

<h3>Number formats</h3>
<p>Number formats in the contants file are particularly tricky, so let us look at those:</p>
<dl>
<dt>An Inch number constant
	<Dd>10.5.inch
	<dd>Note the '.' between the last numeral and the 'inch'.  This is not optional.
<dt>A millimeter constant
	<dd>12.7.mm
	<dd>Note the '.' between the last numeral and the 'mm'.  This is not optional.	
<dt>'Just a number'
	<dd>1.25
	<dd>This will usually be interpreted as a value in inches since the default for measurements in Sketchup is inches.
	In fact all internal measurements are in inches, but the models default units may change, 
	which is why we have to be careful to specify the units 
	using <code>.inch</code> or <code>.mm</code> to tell Sketchup exactly what we mean.

<h3>what can I change in MyConsants.rb?</h3>

self explanatory.<br>   Hopefully, they are!<br>   Lines beginning with '#' are comments and will be ignored by

# stop when changing directions instead of rounding out square corners. When
