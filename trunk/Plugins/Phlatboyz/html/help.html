         SketchUcam is a set of tools in the form of a plugin for Google
         SketchUp. It allows for assigning of CNC cut/fold/drill/mill, etc.
         functions to SketchUp designs as a full featured CAM solution. It was
         designed for use with the Phlatboyz easy to assemble and learn CNC
         machine kits. For more information about these affordable Kits, please

         Since the PhlatScripT is released as open source, anyone and everyone
         is welcome to download it and experiment with it. The ultimate goal is
         to create a complete and powerful CAM solution directly within SketchUp
         capable of outputting 3D tool paths and possibly in the future will be
         the ability to not only output the g-code but control the Phlatprinter
         as well :) Have fun and please let us know how you are using the

      <h4>New in V1.2a</h4>
         <ul>
         <li>Gcode Joiner - on the Phlatboyz menu, this tool allows you to join 2 or more Gcode files together to make a single file that 
            does all of the cuts in the order specified.  This is handy for combining files generated from a drawing that needs seperate operations
            carried out on the same part.
         <li>Use_End_Position - on the Options|Features menu, setting this true allows you to select an ending position other than X0 Y0 for the gantry.
            TIP: use in combination with the Use_Home_Height option.
         <LI>Bug fixes in the 3D Gcode generator.
         <li>3D code that uses multipass will now stop early once all features have been cut, ie it will not 
            continue to full material depth if all features have been cut. 
         </ul>

      <div class="intro">
      <h4>New in V1.2</h4>
         <ul>
         <li>The '<u>Table top is Z-Zero</u>' checkbox.  If this is ticked the table top will be used as the Z zero reference
         instead of the material top surface.  This is most useful on overhead gantry machines, and <i>not at all useful</i> on Phlatprinters.
         <li>The <a href="howto_options.html">Options Menu</a> allows you to set default options that will be applied to new drawings.  These options affect such things as
         your machine type (overhead gantry?) and size (default safe area), common tool settings (feed speeds), and Gcode generation options.
         <i>This menu system replaces the MyConstants.rb file in a transparent way.  Your existing settings will be used until you use the Options menu to change them.</i>
         <li>  profile file format was changed to ini format, extension .pri
         <li>  fix for parameters tool on mac
         <li>  phlatBones preferences file moved to profiles folder, solves write permissions issue on Win7/8
         <li>  Pocketcut: improved undo so entire pocket cut will undo in one operation
         <li>  arcs, extra digit of precision
         <li>  3D - removed full depth plunge at start of last multipass pass that may remove extra material.

         the generated g-code. All g-code output uses the safe cutting
         area's local origin(the bottom left corner) and only
         edges within the safe cutting area will generate g-code. This will
         allow designs requiring multiple sheets to be contained within one
         SketchUp file and the cut codes processed as one sheet at a time for
         separate g-code files for each sheet.  The safe area is assumed to be

         Also, there are 2 check boxes for additional options: <br>
         1) "<u>Generate Multipass</u>" - for cutting hard materials, where you want to limit the depth of cut
         by cutting multiple thin layers. <br>
         2) "<u>Overhead Gantry</u>".  The original 2
         Phlatprinters cut from the bottom with a reversed Y axis. Use this option if you have a Phlatprinter3 or your
         cnc machine has an overhead gantry.  This will reverse the direction of the Inside and Outside cuts.<br>
         See the <a href="howto_options.html">Options Menu help</a> for setting this as a default
         <br><br>

         <p><u>Note</u>: When you press "OK", these settings will be saved as attributes to your
         sketchup model.  So each sketchup file will retain their individual settings.

         New in 1.1c is the ability to save and restore tool profiles.  This allows you to quickly restore a tool setup that relates to 
         a type of material or operation.  For example one might store the settings for a drilling operation with multipass on, low feed speeds etc.
         For a foam milling tool one can store high feed speeds, not multipass and so on.<br>

         <b>Some points to note:</b>         
         <dl>
            <dt>Inside/Outside overcut%
            <dd>This value is used as a multiplier on the material thickness.   The Phlatprinter is designed to cut through sheet material
            so normal cuts must go deeper than the material thickness.  This is normally about 140%, ie through the material and 40% 
            out the other side to account for wavy dollar tree blue foam.   If you are using an overhead gantry and do not want to cut 
            into your spoil board then set this value to 100% and zero your toolbit end accurately.
           <dt>Plunge rate:</dt>
           <dd>used for vertical down moves of the Z axis.  Set this lower than the feed rate for hard materials</dd>
           <dt>Step Over %</dt>
           <dd>This percentage is used by the 3D code generator and by the <b>Pocket Tool</b> to determine how much of the bit diameter to overlap each cut pass.
               Tool manufacturers recommend using 1-30% or 70 to 100%, but not 30-70% as this range increases tool wear.
           <br><b>Only select 'Generate 3D Code' for an actual 3D model.  IF selected for a plain flat drawing, Sketchup Will Stop Responding</b></dd>
            <dt>Tab width
            <dd>Half the bit diameter will be removed from each end of the tab.  Thus a tab width equal or less than the
            bit diameter will not leave a useful tab at all.
           
           <dt>Tab Depth %
           <dd>The percentage of the material thickness to cut away when doing tabs.  Thus 75% will cut away 75% of the material leaving 25% behind.
           
           <dt><br>Show Gcode after output</dt>
           <dd>Ticking this will cause Gplot to display the Gcode directly after generating it. The Gplot program will open after you click 'Ok' to confirm the file save.</dd>

         hover over faces instead of edges.                                      &nbsp; <br><br>

         Note: reversing the face (Edit/Face/Reverse Faces) <i>prior</i>
         to using the Inside Cut Tool will cause the cut direction to be
         reversed. In milling, the rotation of the bit, counter clockwise or
         clockwise, determines which edge of the design will be left rough.
         Normally, in SketchUp, you would leave the default grey side
         facing up for all faces, before you assign cut lines. Otherwise, if the
         face is reversed (white), and a cut line is assigned whether
         inside or outside, the rough edge will be on the part and not the waste. So, in
         short, make sure that the grey side is facing up and the PhlatScripT
         will cut your part file in the right direction leaving a nice clean
         edge on the part.

         <br><br>
         This tool uses the tab width and tab depth factors which are defined in the Parameters dialog.
         Use that dialog to define the tab tool parameters prior to using the tool;
         changing the values in the Parameters dialog will not affect tabs that have already been placed.
         <br><br>
         Use the <u>["End" key]</u>, to toggle from standard Tabs to V-Tabs.  V describes the angled tabs vs the standard rectangular tabs.
         The cursor will change from a T to V to show the current mode.

         Use the <u>["Home" key]</u>, to toggle Bold Tab viewing mode off/on.  When the tab tool is active, this feature makes

         <br><br>
         Note:
         A feature of the Tab Tool is the ability to 'draw' tabs to any width
         you desire always starting with the default width. For example, if the
         tabs placed along a curve are too small, you can hold the left mouse
         button down and draw then in wider. The tab depth will remain the same
         as defined in the parameters dialogue.
         <br><br>
         Note:
         The tab tool has click/drag functionality, for multiple tabs or extending tab width.                 &nbsp;

         status is also shown on the bottom status text.
         The default short mode will shorten both ends of the edge by a small amount.
         The main reason is to break contact and stop the possible creation of an extra face and loop,
         which could confuse the phlatscript.  Wide mode will act normally
         and not offer this protection.  But you can use wide mode, if say you want a connected chain of edges.

         The items on this menu allow you to set many default values that affect your machines operation.
         Please see the help for the  <a href="howto_options.html">Options Menu</a>.
         This menu item replaces the need for editing the Constants and MyConstants files.

         Yes, we know it is misnamed 'Validity Check', that is a Sketchup default we cannot change :-)

         Tool Profiles are saved as 'ini' format text files.  The folder used is within the users APPDATA folder and is a 
         little tricky to find, so we made it simple with this menu item.  Click it and a file explorer will open at the correct folder.

         By grouping elements of your drawing you can set the cut order.  Groups will be cut in the order grouped, or set using the 
         Group Reorder tool.   Use this menu item to see the cut order of your groups.  Note that in order for this to make sense you 
         should name your groups using the Entitity Info dialog box (right click the group, Entity Info).  You can group a bunch of groups.
         Group names will be shown in the Gcode.
