         The PhlatScripT is a set of tools in the form of a plugin for Google
         SketchUp. It allows for assigning of CNC cut/fold/drill/mill, etc.
         functions to SketchUp designs as a full featured CAM solution. It was
         designed for use with the Phlatboyz easy to assemble and learn CNC
         machine kits. For more information about these affordable Kits, please
         visit <a href="http://www.phlatboyz.com/">
         Phlatboyz Machines</a>
         <br><br>
         The vision and direction of the PhlatScripT is Mark and Trish Carew's
         of Phlatboyz, LLC and is released under GLN licensing terms. Since this
         code and the ideas behind it is a collaborative effort among many
         people, it can not be sold in any form. For more information, please
         contact Mark and Trish Carew through www.phlatboyz.com or
         kram2422@comcast.net. It has come to fruition through the help of many
         volunteer programmers, testers, and users. We want to thank everyone
         for your efforts put forth to make this a reality. The PhlatScripT is
         an ever changing and evolving program. <br><br>
         <i>This is a great project and if you would like to contribute your time and talents to help the Phlatscript grow,

      <div class="intro">
         Since the PhlatScripT is released as open source, anyone and everyone
         is welcome to download it and experiment with it. The ultimate goal is
         to create a complete and powerful CAM solution directly within SketchUp
         capable of outputting 3D tool paths and possibly in the future will be
         the ability to not only output the g-code but control the Phlatprinter
         as well :) Have fun and please let us know how you are using the

         Enter <b>Phlatboyz Parameters</b> to set: [spindle speed, feed rate, plunge rate, safe travel,
         material thickness, bit diameter, tab width, tab depth factor, the safe
         cutting area size and comment text] which will appear in
         the generated g-code. All g-code output uses the safe cutting
         area's local origin(the bottom left corner) and only
         edges within the safe cutting area will generate g-code. This will
         allow designs requiring multiple sheets to be contained within one
         SketchUp file and the cut codes processed as one sheet at a time for
         separate g-code files for each sheet.  The safe area is assumed to be
         at sketchup's origin, unless placed elsewhere using the Safe Area Tool.<br><br>

         Also, there are 2 check boxes for additional options: <br>
         1) "<u>multipass</u>" - for cutting hard materials, where you want to limit the depth of cut
         by cutting multiple thin layers. <br>
         2) "<u>Overhead Gantry</u>".  The original 2
         Phlatprinters cut from the bottom with a reversed Y axis. Use this option if you have a Phlatprinter3 or your
         cnc machine has an overhead gantry.  This will reverse the direction of the Inside and Outside cuts.<br><br>

         <p><u>Note</u>: When you press "OK", these settings will be saved as attributes to your
         sketchup model.  So each sketchup file will retain their individual settings.

         <h3>Profiles</h3>
         <p class="newcolour">
         <img src="images/profiles.png" align=right border=1>
         New in 1.1c is the ability to save and restore tool profiles.  This allows you to quickly restore a tool setup that relates to 
         a type of material or operation.  For example one might store the settings for a drilling operation with multipass on, low feed speeds etc.
         For a foam milling tool one can store high feed speeds, not multipass and so on.<br>
         <img src="images/profilesave.png" align="right" border="0">
         Clicking the <b>'Save'</b> button will produce a prompt for a profile name. Profile names must not have spaces or punctuation in them.
         The following settings will be saved
         <table style="font-size: smaller;">

         Note the material thickness is deliberately NOT saved.  The concept of the profile is to save a tool setup for 
         a specific <b>type</b> of material rather than a size of material.

           <dt><br>Plunge rate:</dt>
           <dd>used for vertical down moves of the Z axis.  Set this lower than the feed rate for hard materials</dd>
           <dt>Step Over %</dt>
           <dd>This percentage is used by the 3D code generator and by the <b>Pocket Tool</b> to determine how much of the bit diameter to overlap each cut pass.
           <br><b>Only select 'Generate 3D Code' for an actual 3D model.  IF selected for a plain flat drawing, Sketchup Will Stop Responding</b></dd>
            <dt>Tab width
            <dd>Half the bit diameter will be removed from each end of the tab.  Thus a tab width equal or less than the
            bit diameter will not leave a useful tab at all.
           
           <dt>Tab Depth %
           <dd>The percentage of the material thickness to cut away when doing tabs.  Thus 75% will cut away 75% of the material leaving 25% behind.
           
           <dt><br>Show Gcode after output</dt>

      <td class="command-description">
         <b>Inside Cut Tool</b> - This tool is used to cut out openings.  It is
         assigned to a closed loop of edges and requires a corresponding face.  The cut path is offset to the inside,
         to compensate for the material removed by the cutter. The face will change
         to a transparent texture to resemble a hole. It differs from the outside cut
         tool in that the path cut direction, will be counter-clockwise.<br><br>

         Use the<u>["Shift" key]</u> if the preview shows the inside cut on the wrong side. Just press and
         hold "Shift" prior to clicking.                                                          <br><br>

         Use the <u>["End" key]</u> if the tool locks onto the wrong adjacent face.  You won't need this feature, if you
         hover over faces instead of edges.                                      &nbsp; <br><br>

         Note: reversing the face (Edit/Face/Reverse Faces) <i>prior</i>
         to using the Inside Cut Tool will cause the cut direction to be
         reversed. In milling, the rotation of the bit, counter clockwise or
         clockwise, determines which edge of the design will be left rough.
         Normally, in SketchUp, you would leave the default grey side
         facing up for all faces, before you assign cut lines. Otherwise, if the
         face is reversed (white), and a cut line is assigned whether
         inside or outside, the rough edge will be on the part and not the waste. So, in
         short, make sure that the grey side is facing up and the PhlatScripT
         will cut your part file in the right direction leaving a nice clean
         edge on the part.

         <b>Outside Cut Tool</b> - This tool is used to cut the outside contour

         The cut path is offset to the outside, to compensate for the material removed by the cutter.
         The thin face between the original line and the Outside Cut line will get a transparent texture.
         It differs from the inside cut tool in that the path cut direction, will be clockwise.

         <b>Tab Tool</b> -
         This tool is used to place tabs along any inside or outside cut Phlatboyz edge.
         The tabs hold the parts in place while the media (foam sheet, balsa, cardboard, etc.) moves back and forth in the machine.
         <br><br>
         This tool uses the tab width and tab depth factors which are defined in the Parameters dialog.
         Use that dialog to define the tab tool parameters prior to using the tool;
         changing the values in the Parameters dialog will not affect tabs that have already been placed.
         <br><br>
         Use the <u>["End" key]</u>, to toggle from standard Tabs to V-Tabs.  V describes the angled tabs vs the standard rectangular tabs.
         The cursor will change from a T to V to show the current mode.
         <br><br>
         Use the <u>["Home" key]</u>, to toggle Bold Tab viewing mode off/on.  When the tab tool is active, this feature makes
         the tabs easy to see.  Turn it off, if sketchup slows down when using the tab tool.
         <br><br>
         Note:
         A feature of the Tab Tool is the ability to 'draw' tabs to any width
         you desire always starting with the default width. For example, if the
         tabs placed along a curve are too small, you can hold the left mouse
         button down and draw then in wider. The tab depth will remain the same
         as defined in the parameters dialogue.
         <br><br>
         Note:
         The tab tool has click/drag functionality, for multiple tabs or extending tab width.                 &nbsp;

      </td>
      <td class="command-description">
         <b>Fold Tool</b> -
         This tool is used to define a fold line.  The use of a fold line is
         to create a crease, so a sheet of foam can be folded or bent to form 3d shapes.  Or by using
         a series of stepped depth fold lines, create a hinge line for a model airplane control surface.
         <br><br>
         It automatically selects a single edge.  Press the <u>["Shift" key]</u>, if you want all connected edges.
         <br><br>
         Use the <u>["End" key]</u> to toggle between short and wide mode.  When hovering over an edge, the short
         mode shows a pink color preview.  Wide mode shows a darker red/purple preview color.  Short and Wide mode
         status is also shown on the bottom status text.
         The default short mode will shorten both ends of the edge by a small amount.
         The main reason is to break contact and stop the possible creation of an extra face and loop,
         which could confuse the phlatscript.  Wide mode will act normally
         and not offer this protection.  But you can use wide mode, if say you want a connected chain of edges.

         <br><br>
         Use the <u>["Left Arrow"]["Right Arrow"]</u> keys to scroll through the preset depths: [25%, 50%, 75% & 100%].
         This will result in the cut depth, as a percentage of the material thickness.

         <b>Plunge Tool</b> -
         This tool is used to create a plunge point at any given cursor position.  The use of the plunge tool is to drill holes.
         <br><br>
         The plunge tool creates a circle with a brown radius line extending from the center to the outside diameter.
         The diameter of the circle is determined by the Phlatboyz "Bit Diameter" parameter.
         <br><br>
         The plunge tool allows the generation of gcode required to plunge the bit at the depth indicated
         in the "Material Thickness" Parameters dialog.<br>
         OR<br>
         You can set the percentage depth before you click.  This hole will then be that
         percentage of the material thickness in depth.  You will need to set the depth for every hole.<br>
         AND<br>
         You can hold down the SHIFT key when clicking, and you will be prompted for a diameter.
         The hole will then be spiral bored to that diameter.  This is quite slow so holes that are
         greater than 3 times the diameter of the bit should rather be a circle with an inside cut to remove
         the waste.<br>
         Feedrate will be the normal rate set for cuts.<br>
         Downfeed will be limited to either
         <ul>
         <li>half the bit diameter per revolution</li>
         <li>the multipass depth if multipass is on.</li>

         Notes:
         <ol class="newcolour">
         <li>Note that the various CNC controllers will perform this operation in different ways.
         LinuxCNC will do true spiral decending cuts, while other controllers might step down 
         and do a circle with constant Z instead.
         <li>The normal cut direction is anticlockwise giving a 'climbing cut'.  On stiff machines this will
         give a superior surface finish.   If your machine gives a bad finish in this and pocket cuts, please review the
         <i>Use_pocket_CW</i> and <i>Use_plunge_CW</i> settings in the <a href="howto_changeconstants.html">MyConstants.rb</a> section

         <b>Center line Tool</b> -
         This tool is used to define a center line cut on a SketchUp edge.
         The common use of center lines, is to cut a shallow graphical design or slot.
         If you are able to draw the necessary pattern of lines to form a pocket, you can also use center lines to cut out the pocket.  Pocket milling
         is when you cut out shallow openings, that doesn't penetrate to the other side.
         <br><br>
         It automatically selects all connected edges.  Press the <u>["Shift" key]</u>, if you only want a single edge.
         <br><br>
         Use the <u>["Left Arrow"]["Right Arrow"]</u> keys to scroll through the preset depths: [25%, 50%, 75% & 100%].
