NOTES
bezier spline plugin (dogbones)
    http://sketchucation.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=13563
   gives you 
   dogbones 
   'convert to polyline' which will make several lines into one line when SU didn't do it automatically

loop.convex returns true if the loop is convex

   <TD>USER REQUEST</td>
<td>
   I was using the centerline tool and the perimeter cut tool on 1/4in acrylic sheet today. 
   I use the centerline tool at variable depths such as 50% usually. With a 1/8in diameter 
   bit I am always nervous about breaking it ($35 a piece!) so I tend to slow the travel 
   speed down to about 20in/m  universally so when I do the full cut through the 1/4 I don't 
   risk breaking the bit. But on the 50% cuts I could be running 50in plus. Right now the 
   only way is to go into the gcode and try to find it and make manual changes.
<p>I can't control spindle speed on my router, but I was wondering if it would be a big additional 
   change to have two variables when you select any tool that can have a % depth to also have an 
   entry for travel speed. </p>
   <p>
   Thoughts: could provide for feed speed scaling between a 'speed at 100% depth' to 'speed at <100% depth' where
      speed at 100% will be less than speed at some <100% depth.

   <li>CW/CWW choices for plunge holes and pockets
   <pre>
      Set one or more of
         Use_pocket_CW = false
         Use_plunge_CW = false
      to true to get CW cuts on pockets and plunge holes respectively.  
      Normally these will cut CCW to use climb-milling but if the machine 
      is not stiff enough CW will give a better finish.  The overhead gantry setting 
      will not affect this.
   </pre>
   <li>Phlatprinter outfeed option
   <pre>
      Set
         Use_outfeed = false
      to true to use the outfeed feature.   This is ONLY for Phlatprinters.
      Normally a Phlatprinter will go to 'home' at the end of a job, which means that
      the material is sticking out the back of the machine.
      Setting this option to true causes the material to be fed forward out of the machine
      to 75% of the material 'safe length'.  This should make it easier to remove at the end
      of a job.

1.1d  7 Mar 2014
<dl>
<dt>Group summary
   <dd>Tools|Phlatboyz|Groups Summary
   <dd>Gives a listing of groups in the order they will be cut

<dt>Sketchup Make 2014
   <dd>This uses Ruby 2 which has some API changes. 
   <dd>Parameterstool.rb fixed to use .each_line instead of .each for strings.
   <dd>attributes.rb: changed $f to f to prevent Make2014 moaning. 
   
<dt>Parameters dialog for Mac
   <dd>Fixes to the html to make it work on Mac, so 
      'Use_compatible_dialogs = false' should now work on Mac
      (thanks to Krzysztof)
<dt>Phlatboyz.strings language handler
   <dd>Changes to the language handler so it works across all versions of Sketchup.
   Note that any translations you find on the web are probably out of date by now.  
   Feel free to update the translations and forward them to the dev team.
      
                       
</dl>
<h2>1.1e May 2014</h2>
<dl>
<dt>profile file format was changed to ini format, extension .pri, as a way to test the iniparser library
<dt>fix for parameters tool on mac
<dt>phlatBones preferences file moved to profiles folder, solves write permissions issue on Win7/8
<dt>Pocketcut: improved undo so entire pocket cut will undo in one operation
<dt>arcs, tried optimizing to IJ format but some offset arcs are unfixable, reverted to R format with extra digit of precision
<dt>3D - removed full depth plunge at start of last multipass pass that may remove extra material.
<dt>beta5 - added Z-Zero option to parameters dialog
</dl>

<h2>1.2a Dec 2014</h2>
<dl>
<dt>holes form groups to avoid intersecting existing geometry
   <dd>will still be affected by horizontals that overlay the color line
   <dd>large and partial depth holes have names giving the sizes chosen
<dt>3D code
      <dd>bug found in multipass that prevented G1 being written at start of each layer
      <dd>multipass continues output after lowest feature has been cut, find minz to prevent this.
         you will see a comment at the end of the Gcode if it was able to terminate early
      <dd>to generate accurate code you must specify the material as thicker than it really is
         for example, if using 20mm material, set it to 21 and set Z zero using a 1mm spacer on the material.
         This will ensure that the top is not marked by anomolies, but it does mean that the entire
         top surface will be 'cut', which takes time.
      <dd> always preview 3D code before cutting!
<dt>Gcode Joiner
   <dd> tool to join several gcode files together into one file, stripping headers and footers as needed
<dt>use_End_Position and end_x end_y - 
   <dd>send the gantry to this position after the cuts.  Limited by material size.   
</dl>      

<h2> 1.3 release 1 MAy 2015</h2>
<dl>
<dt>polygons were output as circle segments. 
   <dd>used to be output as circles unless exploded, now correctly detected and output as line segments.
<dt>ramping
   <dd> options for ramping into cuts instead of plunging, ramp on/off, and limit angle
   <dd> defaults on the Options|Features menu
   <dd> options on the parameters dialog
<dt>default parameters
   <dd> 'Restore defaults' button on parameters dialog was not metric aware
<dt>Gcode comment format
      <dd>Options|Machine|Comment option, true outputs () format comments, false outputs ; format comments for GRBL
<dt>Set Vtab ramping
         <dd>a tools menu item to use the current ramp settings to calculate Vtab size to conform to the angle limit.
         
<h2>1.3a released, hash 97c2 on 1 jun 2015</h2>
<dl>
   <dt>lance pointed out an arc error, some arcs are output with the wrong G code making the segments curve the wrong way.
   <dd>this is because of the g3 = reverse ? !.g3? : g3  lines in milledges.
      looks like a problem in the cut_face() routinein CutTool.rb where it checks for the center being inside or outside the face.
      I don't think this is a sufficient test to determine direction, but what else is there?
   <dt>pockets
      <dd>pocket zigzags do not always end in the right place, fix it by using fuzzy stepover similar to the hole boring
      <dd>if stepover = 50% then fuzzy is not used
      <dd> if stepover < 50% then stepover is rounded down
      <dd> if stepover > 50% then stepover is rounded up
   <dt>'use fuzzy stepover' option on Features menu
   <dt>fix to phlatbones to prevent face missing errors
   <dt>upcase all axis words and change G1 to G01.   G0 cannot be set to G00 in aMill at this time, but all specific G0 are not G00.
</dl> 

<h2>1.3b</h2>
<dl>
   <dt>make the path to the gplot program a string in options so it is preserved between versions
