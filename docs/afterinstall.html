<p>After installing Sketchucam all features will work without further setup.
However, there are some settings you will want to change to suite your machines size and capabilities.
</p>
<img src="images/options-machine.png" align="right">

To make these changes you need to access the "<b>Tools|Phlatboyz|Options|Machine Options</b>" menu item as illustrated at right.
<h3>Things you may need to change</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Default_safe_width (X)
    <dd>Set this to the largest workpiece your machine can take in the X direction. 
<dt>Default_safe_height (Y)
    <dd>Set this to the largest workpiece Y size.
<dt>Default_overhead_gantry
    <dd>If all you have is a Phlatprinter, set this to false. If all you have is a gantry type machine, set this to true. If you have both styles, set to the one you use the most.
</dl>
<br clear=all>
<dl>    
<dt><b>Min_z </b>
   <span style="color: red; float: right; width: 50%;">It is VERY IMPORTANT that you get these settings correct.  
      Do NOT set Min_Z to zero unless you also set <b>Default_tabletop is Z-Zero</b> on the Misc Options dialog to TRUE, and NEVER change it
      in the parameters dialog.  Failing to do this correctly will result in faulty G-code generation.<br>
      Min_z = -maxZtravel<br>
      Max_z = maxZtravel<br>
      are the preferred settings, allowing both 'material top' and 'table top' as Z-zero to work properly. 
   </span>
    <dd>Set this to negative (-) your Z travel. G-code will never contain negative Z travel more than this figure. 
<dt><b>Max_z</b>
    <dd>Set this to your Z travel. G-code will never contain Z travel more than this figure.     
</dl>

Now visit the "<b>Tools|Phlatboyz|Options|Tool Options</b>" menu item as illustrated at right.<br>
If you have a flat bed machine you will want to set the <br>
<b>Default_cut_depth_factor</b> to 100%<br>
This will prevent it cutting into the table.   A cut depth factor greater 100% will cut through the material and into the table.<br>
