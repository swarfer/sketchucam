# SketchUcam for Sketchup
SketchUCam is a free plugin written for the Google/Trimble SketchUp CAD program that allows the creation of 
Gcode to control your cnc machines and bring your SketchUp creations into the real world!

The ultimate goal is to create a complete CAM/Controller solution directly within SketchUp 
capable of outputting 2.5D or 3D tool paths and possibly in the future will be the ability 
to not only output the g-code but control the machine as well. We're sure Sketchucam will be 
adapted for many different types of machines. This will be great. Please share.

SketchUcam is made possible though many great volunteers (super heroes) who have contributed to 
the project free of charge! Give a shout out to them.

SketchUcam can not be used for commercial gain or sold in any form. We are keeping this truly open source.

Thank You, Mark and Trish Carew <br>
